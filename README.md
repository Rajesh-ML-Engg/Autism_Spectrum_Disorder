# Predict Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children, Adolescents and Adults
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce it. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. 

The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis.

The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. 

Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases.

**_Autism-Child-Data.arff_** : **ARFF file contains the ASD Children Dataset with 20 features and 292 observations**

**_ASD_Adolescents_Prediction.ipynb_** : Contains the python code for predicting ASD in Adolescents 

**_ASD_Children_Prediction.ipynb_** : Contains the python code for predicting ASD in Children 

Jupyter notebooks comprises the code in below stages:

    1. Data Import
    2. Initial Data Analysis
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis
    4. Models Evaluation
        4.1 Naive Bayes
        4.2 Random Forest
		4.3 Logistic Regression
        4.4 Gradient Boosting Classifier
        4.5 Random Forest
